# Performance Metrics Testing Suite

A comprehensive performance testing framework combining k6 load testing and Playwright end-to-end testing to measure and analyze application performance metrics.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of performance tests designed to:

- Execute load testing scenarios using k6
- Run end-to-end browser tests with Playwright
- Collect and analyze performance metrics
- Generate detailed performance reports

## 🔧 Usage

### k6 Load Testing

Run k6 tests from the `k6-load` directory:

```bash
# Run a basic smoke test
k6 run k6-load/Day1/smoke-to-small-load.js

# Run with custom VUs and duration
k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s k6-load/Day3/checks.js

# Run with custom metrics
k6 run k6-load/Day11/custom-trends.js

# Output results to JSON
k6 run --out json=results.json k6-load/Day4/thresholds.js
```

### Playwright Testing

Run Playwright tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js

# Run tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### k6 Test Types

1. **Smoke Tests** - Minimal load to verify system functionality
2. **Load Tests** - Normal expected load
3. **Stress Tests** - Beyond normal capacity
4. **Spike Tests** - Sudden traffic increases
5. **Soak Tests** - Extended duration tests

### Custom Metrics Available

- **login_duration** - Tracks response time for authentication
- **total_requests** - Counts all HTTP requests
- **success_rate** - Monitors request success ratio
- **response_size** - Measures response payload size

### Example Thresholds

```javascript
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],
    login_duration: ['p(95)<1000'],
    success_rate: ['rate>0.95'],
  },
};
```
